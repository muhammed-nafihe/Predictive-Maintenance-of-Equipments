# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Equipments

This repository contains a series of machine learning experiments and models developed using various techniques. The project focuses on preprocessing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), applying different machine learning models, and fine-tuning these models for optimal performance.


The repository includes the following datasets:

dataset1.csv: The raw dataset used in this project.
preprocessed_dataset.csv: The dataset after initial preprocessing steps.
split_data.pkl: The dataset split into training and testing sets.
Preprocessing
The preprocessing of data is an essential step before applying machine learning models. The preprocessing steps used in this project are documented in preprocessing.ipynb. The notebook covers data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process is documented in EDA.ipynb. This notebook includes visualizations and statistical analyses to understand the distribution of the data, relationships between variables, and potential anomalies or outliers.

# Feature Selection
Feature selection is crucial to improving model performance by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features. The steps and techniques used for feature selection are outlined in featureselection.ipynb.

# SMOTE
To handle class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied. The implementation and impact on model performance are documented in SMOTE.ipynb

# Models
This project explores various machine learning models, each documented in its respective notebook:

DNN.ipynb


LogisticRegression.ipynb


RandomForest.ipynb

SVM.ipynb
XGBoost.ipynb
